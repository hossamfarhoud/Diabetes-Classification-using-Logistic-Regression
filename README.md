# Diabetes-Classification-using-Logistic-Regression
🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using Logistic Regression. It leverages the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset to demonstrate an end-to-end workflow including data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

🔧 What You'll Learn 
- How to preprocess and analyze medical datasets.
-Techniques for standardizing and splitting data.
-Implementing Logistic Regression for binary classification.
-Visualization techniques for better insights.
-Evaluating model performance with metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy.
-Making predictions for new inputs.

📖 Dataset Details
The PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset contains the following features:
-Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.
-Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration.
-BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
-SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
-Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
-BMI: Body Mass Index (kg/m²).
-DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Genetic predisposition indicator.
-Age: Age of the patient (years).
-Outcome: Target variable (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic).

🔗 Project Workflow
🚦 Step 1: Importing Libraries
Essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are used for data manipulation, visualization, and model building

🛠 Step 2: Data Exploration
-Check for missing values and explore data types.

🔬 Step 3: Data Preprocessing
-Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler.
-Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.

⚙️ Step 4: Model Implementation
-Train a Logistic Regression model for classification.

🧪 Step 5: Model Evaluation
-Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate performance.
-Plot the balance of the Outcome variable for insights.

🔍 Step 6: Feature Importance Analysis
-Visualize feature importance using Logistic Regression coefficients.

🧩 Step 7: Prediction on New Data
-Use the trained model to predict diabetes for a new data input.

📊 Visualizations Included
-Correlation heatmap to explore feature relationships.
-Histograms to understand feature distributions.
-Bar chart to display the balance of the target variable.
-Feature importance plot based on model coefficients.

🌟 Future Enhancements
